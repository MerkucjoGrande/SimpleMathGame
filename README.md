# SimpleMathGame
A simple program that asks user to input a correct answer - also it measures how good a user did and count his score

<h1> Original Idea </h1>
<p>This is my first program ever publicly uploaded! The program is just a simple math game (as the name suggest). The idea is also very simple - you pick your difficulty
then the program will generate randomized numbers based on your input. The difficulty scaling might not be great but I think it does it job as it should. Originally 
I wanted to implement time measure so the user score could be more interesting and the time preassure would generally give more flavour to the game. Eventually I left
that idea</p>
<h2> Code info </h2>
<p>The program was written proceduraly - that being said it's not perfect nor clean. It's packed with functions, and I suppose some of them are not perfect, some are
might be useless. I will be more than happy to hear or to see any comments and criticism.</p>
<h2> Version 2 </h2>
<p> The second version of the program will be or at this point might actually be avilalble at my git repos </p>
